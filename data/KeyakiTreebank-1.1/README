Keyaki Treebank (Version 1.1)
=============================

Thanks for your interest in this release of the Keyaki Treebank.

The Keyaki Treebank is a parsed corpus that aims to instantiate a coherent
descriptive grammar of the Japanese language, allowing searches for
a wide variety of grammatical phenomena.  More information about the
corpus can be found on the project website:

(A) Corpus Format
=================

Keyaki Treebank files are formatted to be compatible with CorpusSearch,
see http://corpussearch.sourceforge.net/CS-manual/YourCorpus.html for
details.


(B) Recovering the full data
============================

The 'closed' folder contains annotations for data sourced from the
following purchasable resources, which are required to reinstate words
stripped off due to license issues:

- Mainichi Shinbun 1995 CD-ROM data collection (the same set of data
  as used by the Kyoto Text Corpus). Available from Nichigai Associates:
  http://www.nichigai.co.jp/sales/mainichi/mainichi-data.html.

- Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) DVD-ROM data
  Available from http://pj.ninjal.ac.jp/corpus_center/csj/en/

- Balanced Corpus of Comtemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ) DVD edition
  Available from http://pj.ninjal.ac.jp/corpus_center/bccwj/.

- (SIDB) Simultaneous Interpretation Database
  Available from http://sidb.jp/

The full corpus is obtained by running the following commands:

 ./scripts/collect_MAI_data -d MAINICHI_DIR
 ./scripts/integrate_MAI_characters
 ./scripts/integrate_CSJ_characters --source CSJ_DIR
 ./scripts/integrate_BCCWJ_characters --source BCCWJ_DIR
 ./scripts/integrate_SIDB_characters --source SIDB_DIR

where:

 'MAINICHI_DIR' is the directory of the files of Mainichi Shinbun 1995.
 'CSJ_DIR' is the directory of the files of the CSJ DVD-ROM
 'BCCWJ_DIR' is the directory of the files of the BCCWJ DVD-ROM
 'SIDB_DIR' is the directory of the files of the SIDB

In order to run these commands, you need Perl, Python, Gawk, Tregex
(https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tregex.shtml) and munge-trees
(http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/Software.htm).

For Tregex to work, stanford-tregex.jar should be placed into the
same directory as this README file.

The program for extracting texts from Mainichi
Shinbun 1995 is from the Kyoto Corpus project
(http://nlp.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/index.php?Kyoto%20University%20Text%20Corpus).
